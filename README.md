TASK 2: To Explore Supervised Machine Learning
In this regression task we predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. Also the predicted score if a student studied for 9.25 hrs in a
day is calculated and displayed.
This is done using 2 different methods and the performance of both is measured.
